### Hey there
Comtraya! I'm Evan (or Avern online!) Truth be told? I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know why I'm here, what I'm doing or why. 
But the real question is, does anyone? And* perhaps more importantly, **does it matter?**

Always open to learning new things, if anyone has a suggestion, question, or even a complaint, add me on discord 'novoavern' or email me at *me@avern.dev*

*yes i am aware you cannot start a sentence with "And", but omg throw me a bone its for effect*
